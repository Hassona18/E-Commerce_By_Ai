#### **MongoDB (Database)**:
- **NoSQL Database**:
  - Storing e-book details, user data, orders, and reviews in collections.
  - Flexibility to scale with a schema-less model for dynamic product listings and categories.
  
- **Mongoose ORM**:
  - Schema and model management for MongoDB with Node.js.

- **AI-Driven Data**:
  - Store user behavior data to train AI models (e.g., recommendation engine or search optimization).

- **Sharding & Replication**:
