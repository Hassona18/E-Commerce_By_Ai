These focus on the performance, security, and scalability of the system.

    Performance:
        The system must be able to handle high traffic volumes and multiple concurrent users.
        Quick response times for search, recommendations, and order processing.

    Scalability:
        The platform should be horizontally scalable to support growing user numbers, using microservices architecture.
        The AI models must dynamically scale based on the increasing dataset.

    Security:
        Secure authentication with password encryption using bcrypt or argon2.
        Data security using SSL for communications and encryption of sensitive information.
        Implement fraud detection to prevent malicious transactions.

    Availability:
        Ensure high availability with data replication and server redundancy.
        99.9% uptime with disaster recovery mechanisms in place.

    Usability:
        Simple, intuitive UI design to allow easy navigation and fast checkouts.
        Multilingual support to cater to a global audience.
